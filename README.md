# Visual Entropy BIP39

**Visual Entropy BIP39** explores innovative methods for generating cryptographic keys using visual entropy, aiming to enhance the security of traditional BIP39 seed phrases by incorporating image-based randomness.

## Overview

This project investigates the potential of using images to introduce entropy into the creation of cryptographic seed phrases. By leveraging visual data, it seeks to:

- Reduce predictability inherent in standard seed generation methods.
- Enhance resistance against brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Offer an alternative approach to secure key generation.

## Features

- **Image-Based Entropy**: Utilize images to generate unique entropy sources for seed phrase creation.
- **BIP39 Integration**: Aligns with the BIP39 standard for mnemonic phrase generation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive notebook (`image-based-seed-phrase.ipynb`) demonstrates the methodology and implementation.
- **Supporting Materials**: Includes a PDF paper detailing the approach and sample images used in the process.
