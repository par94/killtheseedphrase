    "### Cryptographic Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tEntropy:\n",
    "* Definition: Entropy measures the unpredictability or randomness in a system. Higher entropy indicates more randomness and better security.\n",
    "* Image-Based Method: Entropy is derived from the unique pixel values in the image. Larger images with more unique colors provide higher entropy.\n",
    "* Traditional BIP-39 Seed Phrase: Each word in the BIP-39 word list represents 11 bits of entropy. A 12-word seed phrase provides 128 bits of entropy.\n",
    "2.\tCollision Resistance:\n",
    "* Definition: Collision resistance ensures that two different inputs do not produce the same hash output.\n",
    "* Image-Based Method: The hash of the entire image data should be unique for different images.\n",
    "* Traditional BIP-39 Seed Phrase: Each seed phrase should produce a unique hash.\n",
    "3.\tBrute-force Resistance:\n",
    "* Definition: Brute-force resistance measures the difficulty of guessing a secret through exhaustive search.\n",
    "* Image-Based Method: The large number of possible pixel combinations provides high brute-force resistance.\n",
    "* Traditional BIP-39 Seed Phrase: The limited set of word combinations provides lower brute-force resistance compared to image-based methods.\n",
    "4.\tStatistical Randomness:\n",
    "* Definition: Statistical randomness tests ensure that the output does not exhibit any predictable patterns.\n",
    "* Image-Based Method: The chi-square test on pixel values helps verify the randomness of the image data.\n",
    "* Traditional BIP-39 Seed Phrase: Deterministic in nature, hence this test is not applicable.\n",

    "### Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Entropy measures the unpredictability or randomness in a system. Higher entropy indicates more randomness and better security.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tImage-Based Method: The entropy values for the images are significantly higher (3048, 2904, and 2976 bits) compared to the traditional method. This high entropy is due to the unique pixel values in the images, providing a vast amount of randomness.\n",
    "•\tTraditional Method: The entropy is fixed at 132 bits, standard for a 12-word BIP-39 seed phrase. While secure for practical purposes, it is significantly lower than the image-based method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collision Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Collision resistance ensures that two different inputs do not produce the same hash output.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tImage-Based Method: All images are collision-free, meaning each image generates a unique hash and consequently a unique seed phrase. This demonstrates good collision resistance.\n",
    "•\tTraditional Method: All seed phrases are collision-free, ensuring that each phrase generates a unique hash. This is expected given the design of BIP-39.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brute-force Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Brute-force resistance measures the difficulty of guessing a secret through exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tImage-Based Method: The brute-force resistance is approximately 1843.83 bits, indicating an extremely large search space for potential brute-force attacks. This is due to the vast number of possible pixel combinations in a 1024x1024 image.\n",
    "•\tTraditional Method: The brute-force resistance is 132 bits, consistent with the entropy. While still secure, it is much lower than the image-based method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Statistical randomness tests ensure that the output does not exhibit any predictable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tImage-Based Method: The chi-square test results indicate some deviation from expected randomness. High chi-square values and extremely low p-values (close to 0) suggest that the pixel values may not be perfectly random, but the vast amount of data (large images) compensates for it in terms of security.\n",
    "•\tTraditional Method: Not applicable, as BIP-39 seed phrases are deterministic and do not require a randomness test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image-Based Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tHigh Entropy: Provides significantly higher entropy compared to traditional methods, indicating better security.\n",
    "•\tHigh Brute-force Resistance: Extremely resistant to brute-force attacks due to the large number of possible combinations.\n",
    "•\tUnique Hashes: Demonstrates good collision resistance with unique hashes for each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tStatistical Randomness: Chi-square test results suggest deviations from perfect randomness, but the high entropy compensates for this.\n",
    "•\tPracticality: Requires storing and processing large images, which can be cumbersome compared to text-based seed phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional Seed Phrase Method (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tStandardized: Widely used and accepted in the cryptocurrency community.\n",
    "•\tSimplicity: Easy to generate, store, and use.\n",
    "•\tSecure: 132 bits of entropy is considered secure for most practical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLower Entropy: Lower than the image-based method, indicating potentially less randomness.\n",
    "•\tLower Brute-force Resistance: Easier to brute-force compared to the image-based method, though still extremely difficult in practice.\n"
